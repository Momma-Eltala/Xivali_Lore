<p>The Xivali live in a Ring World named Xelon, with a red dwarf star in the center, which their Ring World
    temperature is around -40 Fahrenheit or -40 Celsius on average. The Xivali have a beautiful bioluminescent forest
    that they themselves spanned across around the most of the Ring World. it also have large ammonia oceans. This Ring
    World also acts as a shipyard, and a hub for logistics. Also, Xelon is protected by 16 Scarlat Nexuses. While the
    length of the total land mass itself is roughly 3.6 Billion square miles with a radius of 149,000,000 km. The size
    of Xelon means it has a lot of mass and gravity generators, which means it makes its own gravity so the nearby Dwarf
    star, which prevents the accident of Xivali getting pulled towards to the star, but Xelon's gravity is much greater,
    so the gravity is the same as Avalon. Xelon is a safe place for the Xivali to live. It has all the luxurious needs
    you can imagine! Ranging from lovely parks to museums housing some of the rarest items the Xivali have discovered.
    Some Xivali don't like it that they can only have four children, but this is so the population can stay under
    control, so they are at a stable rate. Xelon is powered by the red dwarf star's heat and radiation, as the heat
    energy made is turned into useable power. Xelon houses most Xivali population. This ring world also has a warp drive
    to find a new star when its current location is at risk of going supernova or to avoid battle as they will only
    fight if they have too. It took the Xivali 400 years to complete this Giga structure. Xelon also has underground
    caverns, which is shielded from radiation, this is where aliens would live for there safety, and the plants in there
    are also bioluminescent.</p>
