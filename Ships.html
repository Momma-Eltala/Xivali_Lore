            <h1>Fighters</h1>

            <p>Fighter Craft are small aerospace craft with two types of dual swivel energy or kinetic primary and secondary guns which have a 45° angle travel distance via yaw and pitch. The weapons are track the pilot's retina position to fire extremely accurate shots. The ships have basic shielding and survival kits for the pilot. The fighter ships do not have any throttle or control sticks, instead the controls are operated via a neural connection directly into the Brain of the pilot. This connection allows precise and extremely fast reaction times for the pilot to increase survivability in battle. These ships consume 100 megawatts of power alone, although, these ships also use a fusion engine using mainly hydrogen, which in turn also gives the pilot radiation for nutrition.</p>
            
            <h1>Mining ships</h1>
            
            <p></p>Xivali mining operations consist of planet/star cracker type vessels to mine gasses and minerals while typically completely destroying a star or planet. These vessels are about the size of the Earth’s Moon. These ships use a reversed tractor beam-like tool, crushing the surface or disrupting the gasses of the star or planet. There is another version of the tractor beam that then pulls up the gasses or minerals up into the ship’s designated cargo departments. This process can take up to months or years to complete but is most of the time is worth it. 
            
            <h1> Drones</h1>Combat
            
            <p>These drones can be found in cruisers, larger ships, and/or a Scarlat Nexus; These have a top speed of 600 miles per hour (0.90 Mach). They have light weaponry and need a cruiser or larger vassal or a Scarlat Nexus to be controlled. They have basic armor plating with a pointed nose that allows them to go through an entire ship if they come in close proximity with them. Mostly leaving them unharmed and a gaping hole in the enemy ship. The drone’s light weaponry is an electromagnetic railgun-launched sabot round with a heated plasma field around it, so it can go through advanced shielding and heat up enemy armor making its armor penetrating aspect far easier.</p> 
            
            <h1>Scarlat Nexus</h1>
            
            <p1>This massive station houses 4,000 combat drones. The hangar for these drones is 250 square miles (which is about 160,000 acres). This super station has a hive mind the size of a 2,000 square feet room with advanced armor plating, which only the shields will be put down to let the drones in or out. It is managed by 4 crew members, 2 commanders and 2 engineers.</p1> 
            
            <h1>Frigates</h1> 
            
            <p>These ships are small and agile with heavy armants to crush enemy forces. While still having basic armor, they can take a good beating before even starting to take actual damage. These ships are small, agile and don’t need a lot of power to operate. These ships use a fusion reactor that generates 200 gigawatts of energy. These ships usually house 80 crew members. 40 spare crew and 40 crew on the job, so the ship is at full operation and capacity at all times.</p> 
            
            <h1>Destroyers</h1>
            
            <p>These are another type of small Xivali ship with advanced shielding. Destroyers have a heavy energy cannon that when the projectile collides with enemy armor, it creates an explosion that yields 1 megaton of TNT. these ships are mostly AI controlled but has up to 3 operators to assist the AI. These ships need about 2 terajoules of power to use for each shot.</p>
            
            <h1>Cruisers</h1>
            
            <p>These medium sized ships are fast ship but have advanced armor plating. These have two medium sized dual cannon turrets and have four combat drones for support if needed. Cruisers have 360 crew members 160 active, and the others are not, until they switch shifts to let the others rest. These ships need a neutronium reactor, as these ships have the power requirement of 1 terawatt.</p> 
            
            <h1>Battlecruisers</h1>
            
            <p>These beasts are large ships. The ships are measured to be about 6 miles long with 6 medium-sized dual barrel cannons. The Battlecruiser weaponry is the same as combat drone, only just at a very scaled up size. Battlecruiser ships also have 100 combat drones for defense and offense. Which also have advanced armor plating. These ships have a power need of 6 terawatts of power, which they also need a crew of 60 in order to control the AI which micromanages the ship. The crew members act as engineers and as commanders for the AI.</p>
            
            <h1>Battleships</h1>
            
            <p>These are big and slow ships that have a lot of weapons. The weaponry has 4 heavy energy artillery cannons like on the Destroyers, with hundreds of heavy and medium energy cannons, and light weapons for basic defense. The ships are capable of housing 4,000 combat drones and anti-air FLAK weapons, and neutronium grain torpedoes. The ships have advanced armor and is about 200 miles long. These ships are also some of the more common ships because the Xivali want to go for brute strength. Battleships have FTL capabilities and need 500 terawatts of energy. This ship is containing an advanced AI and a Crew of 2,000 members. They also have a lot of Recreational rooms.</p>
            
            <h1>Dreadnoughts</h1>
            
            <p>These ships are about 1000 miles long, these ships only have large plasma and energy cannons. These are the main weapons, and they are similar to the plasma artillery ones but only faster, also anti-air FLAK weapons and other weapons systems to protect it. These ships need at least a whole zetawatt of power. They also have advanced armor plating. They have very little crew as a ship this large is unethical to be piloted via organism instead of by AI. Dreadnought ships are controlled by the main AI on Xelon. The Dreadnoughts are not used for combat and are more used as a last resort.</p>
